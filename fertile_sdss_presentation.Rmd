# Reproducibility

.pull-left[

• When code + data files produce **identical** results when run by another analyst

### Why this is important:
  - Research is increasingly data-driven
  - Knowledge can be shared worldwide rapidly
  - Transparency
  - Specific feedback
  - Sharing of knowledge / future work

# Reproducibility challenges

• No consensus on standards of reproducibility in research
  - **components** (e.g. need it be open source?)
  - **recommendations** (e.g. should raw / processed data be stored separately?)
  
• Discussion is very generalized
  - For any software
  - Difficult to implement (particularly for new analysts)

# fertile addresses this


• `fertile`: An R package that focuses on common mistakes data analysts make in R

### Two modes

• Proactive 
  - Stops mistakes as they are happening
  
• Retroactive
  - Analyzes already-written code for potential issues



---
# Proactive use

• Identifies potential mistakes as they are made

• Outputs an informative message and a recommended solution

.pull-left[

• Ex: detecting problematic file paths (absolute or pointing outside a directory)

]

.pull-right[

• Ex: setting working directories

]

---
# Retroactive use

• Analyze an RStudio project:
  - Directory structure
  - File path use
  - Randomness
  
• Provide recommendations for remedies

• Features easily accessed w/ two simple functions

---
# Retroactive use

### 1. `proj_check()`

• Runs 15 reproducibility checks
  - Clear build chain
  - Clutter-free project root level
  - No unused files
  - Randomness without `set.seed()`
  
• Notes which pass/fail

• Gives recommendations for addressing issues

• Gives a guide of where to look for help

# Retroactive use

### 2. `proj_analyze()`

• Creates a report focused primarily on the structure of a data analysis project

• Contains:
  - Packages referenced
  - Files / types
  - Suggestions for reorganization
  - Problematic file paths

# Why `fertile` matters

• `fertile` lowers barriers to reproducibile data analysis in R

• Provides non-generalized recommendations

• Near-effortless accessibility 

• Good for analysts of all skill levels / backgrounds

---

# `fertile` is different

• There are already R packages (some still in development) trying to address this issue:
  -rrtools
  -represtools
  -orderly
  -workflowr
  -checkers
  
• However, many of these are:
  -Complicated and difficult for beginners
  -Focused on just one aspect of reproducibility

• `fertile` is incredibly simple to use and covers a wide variety of topics

# Testing `fertile`

• Is `fertile` actually effective for teaching reproducibility?
• Experimented in a Smith College introductory data science course

• Findings:
